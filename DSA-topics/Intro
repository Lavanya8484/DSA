Time complexity constraints:
i)Ignore Smaller values
ii)Focus on worst Case
iii)Ignore Constants


To solve a problem we have 3 steps
Step-1: Write some piece of lines and it contains 2-for loops to get Step-2 and in Step-2 you will run 1 more for-loop to get step-3 in step-3 
i will write the code in constant time and if we analyze the code the Time-Complexity will be n^2 for step-1 and n for step-2 and 1/constant for step-3
to get the time complexity for the code we have to ignore constants smaller values and the final time-complexity will be n^2
i)Best-case: Getting efficient output
ii)Average-case: Average of best and worst
iii)worst-case: Getting the output in Maximum time denoted by O()....


Space-Complexity:
If we use any extra space for solving the problem that extra space is called space-complexity
