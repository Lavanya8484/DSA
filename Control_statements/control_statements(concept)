Two types of Control Statements:
i)Entry-control loops
ii)exit-control loops

*Entry control loops:
->for loop and while loop 

->for-loop Syntax:
for(start;end;diff){
//statements
}
for(intialization;condition;updation){
//statements
}

->while loop syntax:
start;
while(end){
diff;
//statements;
}

->when we know the range we prefer to use for-loop
->when we dont know the range we prefer to use while loop 

//EXAMPLE:
int arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5};
for(int i = 0;i<n;i++){
return arr[i]
}
