ArrayList:-
-> Array is having fixed size once it is declared we cant change
-> to increase the array size dynamically we have to use arrayList it belongs to collection framework
FrameWork:-
FrameWork is nothing but predefined methods and it will guide the program 

Syntax:-
list<Wrapper class> ArrayListName = new ArrayList<>();
ex:-
ArrayList <Integer> leaders = new ArraList<>();

->List is an interface and interface contains incomplete methods
-> Wrapper class is not an primitive data-type it's a class and in collections we have to use wrapper classes only 
-<> angular brackets called Generics(<>)
->ArrayList is a class and which contains complete methods

-> ArrayList is an dynamic Array, if my array size is 2 if im trying to add third element the size will be doubled and it'll copy
previous elements vice-versa the array will become half(when you remove elements) 

-> As arrayList is a class  you have to import the ArraList class so we can access all the predefined methods of ArrayList
