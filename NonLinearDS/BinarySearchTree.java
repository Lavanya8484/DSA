Binary Search Tree :
Left < Root < Right 
adv:
  -For BST, if you print inOrder Traversal you will get output in Sorted Order
disadv:
The tree Might Skewed (all nodes have only one child)

*Balanced-Tree : height(left tree) - height(right tree) = -1/0/1


*AVL:
 AVL tree is self-balenced tree
 There are 4 types:
i) Left-Left
ii) Right-Right 
iii) Right-Left
iv) Left-Right

*Segment Tree:
In an array we have to get Sum of particular range values we will use a simple for loop we will get o/p and time complexity will be O(n)
  and we want to get the o/p in log(n) so we can use segment tree's to get targeted output in log(n) time complexity
