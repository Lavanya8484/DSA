Tries:
- We have to create a node which can store character Array of size 26
- Initialize boolean flags and Pointers - Node next;
- The last node need to change the flag to True

Advantage :
 -To get faster retrivals of strings 

A Trie is a tree-like data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve strings, especially useful for prefix-based searching.
