Heap : Heap Data Structure will store the data in arrays ,it will be stored by trees and the values will be arranged by trees
  - With the help of complete binary tree the elements are arranged accordingly
  - With the help of priority queues Heaps got created!
  - Trees + Arrays = Heaps
  - As the Data are storing in the array so we can Access the elements in arrays and as well as in Trees
  - it involves in using Tree DataStructure so it is a Non-Linear DataStructure 
  - There is a Scope of using Index values

  
There are Two Type of aproaches:
i)Bottom to Top 
ii) Top to Bottom
