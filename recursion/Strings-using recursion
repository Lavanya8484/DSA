Assume that we are starting with two strings input and output string , initially the output is empty, we have few
steps they are:
i) take first character from the string and store it in a character_variable
ii) check the variable with our target character
iii) if it matches just return otput string else append character to output
iv) next, slice the string by onr character to make sure that the remaining string should start with index-1
v) for slicing the string we have substring() method
vi) for accesing the string index we have string_name.charAt(0)

-> Whenever input string becomes empty we have to stop the recurssion that is the Base-case
