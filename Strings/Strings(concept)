-> Strings are classes and Arrays are objects 
->The sequence of characters that ends with null character is called Strings
->Strings are immutable so they are fixed, we can't modify the string
->All the array Objects will be created in Heap memory but Strings are created inside Heap Memory in StringPool

ex:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      String a = "Hello";
      String b = "Hello";
      String c =  new String("Hello");
      String d = new String("Hello");
      System.out.println(a == b); //true 
      System.out.println(c == d); //false
  }
}
-> while comparing Strings a and b we will get true because both the strings are created at same memory location 
-> while comparing Stringd c and d they are actually objects which are created at two different memory locations so we get false 

->From the above example:-
System.out.println(a.equals(b)); //true
System.out.println(c.equals(d)); //true
str1.equals(str2) is used to compare data where as == used to compare mem-locations
