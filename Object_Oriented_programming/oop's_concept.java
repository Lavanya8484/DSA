4 pillars of object oriented programming are :
  i) Inheritance
  ii)Polymorphism
  iii)Encapsulation
  iV) abstraction
-> To archive above properties the pre-requriements are Class,Object,Constructor and Interface
->Class : Class is a Virtual entity and Blueprint of Objects, class is a place where we define objects 
->Object : Instance of a class is called object , we can call the methods which are present in that particular class by creating objects for that 
           particular class 
->Constructor : Initializing the objects 
Two-Types: i)Default constructor ii) Parametrized constructor
->i) For every class there will be default default constructors 
->ii) For every class there will be firstBenchers they will have some parameters(like, attendance,marks....) in similar way the constructors which are having 
     parameters are known as parametrized constructors. 

Inheritance :- There are 4-types
  i) Single
  ii) Multi-Level
  iii) Multiple
  iv) Heirarcal Inheritance

Single Inheritance:- The properties are inherited from parent class to child class 
Multi-Level Inheritance:- Properties are inherited from parent class to GrandParent class and Parent Class
Multiple :- Properties are inherited from multiple parent classes to child class
Hierachical :- Properties are inherited to multiple child classes from single Parent class
->using extend keyword we can inherit the properties from "classes" 
-> using implement keyword we can inherit the properties from "Interfaces" 

Polymorphism :- Same method Appearing multiple times 
  Two types:i)method-overloading ii) method-overriding
  i)Method-overloading: in same class if we have multiple methods with same name with differnt parameters 
  ii) method-overriding: in child class if we declare a method which were present in parent class 
     in same class if we have multiple methods with same  names with same parameters
 NOTE:Main method can be over-ridden with different parameters 

Encapsulation :- binding methods and data and hiding sensitive data is called encapsulation 
  -> if the variables are private we cant access outside the class, if we want to access we can access using methods

Abstraction :- Hiding implementation details and showing only essesntial  details to the user
  Four-types : i) data-abstraction ii) Functional-Abstraction iii)Procedural-Abstraction iv)Control-Abstraction
  ->If we want to make method abstract we have to use "Abstract" keyword and if we have Abstract-method we have to make the
   corresponding class Abstract class
  -> abstract method is a incomplete method

  Interface :-It contains All abstract methods
  -> we cant't create objects for interface
