2D Array:
2-dimensional arrays consists of rows and coloumns
Syntax:
int[][] arr = new int[3][2]; -> the first square represents "rows" and second square bracket represents "coloumns"
-> While declaring the array we have to declare number of rows and coloumn numbers are optional 
-> Each row will act as an individual array 
arr[5] = {1,2,3} size = 3, length = 5
for 2-d array the size will be first sq.bracket
